## Haosen

1. In your proposal describe what you seek to convey.

   1. Explore and analyze your dataset to find some interesting aspects or findings worth sharing.
      * We have about six datasets to support our ideas. We can talk about compositions, and many other aspects of EV.

2. The story must feature at least one programmatically-generated visual representation of data

   1. This visual representation must be the main visual focus of the story (i.e. the main character). This representation can be a visual metaphor, a glyph, or some advanced visualization. 
   2. It can be accompanied and supported by ancillary visualizations or alternative assets to help support the story and advance to the next part.
      * Parrallel coordinate plot for car sales.
      * Time sliders -> time axis.


   

   ## Boquan

   1. In your proposal describe what your visualization idea will be (you do not have to implement it yet you can have a sketch and explain how it will behave).
      * We will also have pie chart, line chart, and bar chart to support it.
         * Pie chart: Percentage of the market per different companies (TESLA, BMW, and Honda).
         * Line chart: More about stock changes.
         * Parallel plot: Different properties of a given model (battery, horsepower, and etc).
      * We can have a map which feature the density of charging port.
3.  How will you convey this story?
   * vertical bars for selection.
   * Begin with an introduction: the US is pushing for more EVs. State the purpose.
   1. What storytelling structure will you use as a starting point (Interactive Slideshow, Martini-Glass, Drill-Down)?
      * Martini-Glass
      1. Explain why you picked that structure. 
         * The choice of making informed decision about EV purchase should be personal choices. They should have some interactivity with our project, but we also want to provide some guidance.
   2. Provide a storyboard or written outline of how you will present this information.

      1. What type of visual encoding(s) you will use, how will you help direct the audience's attention from story point to story point. 

      

      
   ## Alex      

      1. What is the best sequence you can order these findings to effectively communicate them?
         * Introduce EV as the US solution for climate change. And then the details.
         * Inform readers to make their best EV choice.
            * Start with introduction -> our solution.
      2. Do you need to provide context or explain certain aspects so that the audience will be able to follow along?
      3. How will you transition between points?
         * Visualization to transition to a different points. Basic animations.
